CREATE table "tablename" ("coloumn""datatype""[constraint]")
	some data type: char(size), varchar(size), number(size), date, number(size,d)

INSERT INTO tablename  (first_column,...last_column)
  values (first_value,...last_value)

UPDATE tablename SET column=newvalue WHERE column=value

DELETE FROM tablename [WHERE ...] not specifying cause delete whole table
	DROP delete everything while TRUNCATE saves the structure

SELECT * FROM whatever

	WHERE condition1 AND/OR condition2
	WHERE col IN/NOTIN {set of cols}
	WHERE value BETWEEN/NOTBETWEEN num1 AND num2

	SELECT * FROM albums LEFT JOIN artists ON albums.artist_id=artists.id;
For choosing, use LIKE syntax for regex

-WHERE determine before aggregation, HAVING check after aggregation

-ORDER BY caluse syntax[ ASC/ DESC ]

Another Example:
	SELECT
	  albums.name AS 'Album',
	    albums.year,
	      artists.name AS 'Artist'
	      FROM
	        albums
		JOIN artists ON
		  albums.artist_id = artists.id
		  WHERE
		    albums.year > 1980;


MIN/MAX/SUM/AVG/COUNT function
	when COUNT(*) , return number of row
	ROUND(col, num), return values in column in decimal places
	ROUND by default rounds to nearest int
more function
	ABS/MOD/FLOOR/CEIL/POWER(x, y)/SQRT
	SIGN	<-	return the sign of input
